This is painter project that was worked on back in 2019. It was built on openprocessing.org.

Try it out yourself: https://openprocessing.org/sketch/649686

How to use:

* Click on the whitebox to erase the canvas.
* 3 colors to choose from, red, green, and blue.
* 2 different stroke sizes. NOTE: You cannot change stroke size while in ERASE mode.
* Use SHIFT key to use the eraser. 

You cannot draw on the yellow areas of the canvas for obvious reasons.
